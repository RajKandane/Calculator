## Introduction

The Calculator project is a simple web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on numbers.

## Technologies Used

The Calculator was developed using the following technologies:

- HTML 
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Features

- Responsive and user-friendly design.
- Buttons for numeric input and arithmetic operations.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear button to reset the input.
- Ability to handle complex calculations with multiple operands.

## Getting Started

To use the Calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The calculator will load, and you can start performing calculations right away.

## Directory Structure
- /css               # Directory for CSS styles for the calculator interface
    - styles.css      # CSS file with styling rules
- /js                # Directory for JavaScript code and calculator logic
    - script.js       # JavaScript file containing the calculator logic
- index.html         # HTML file with the calculator's UI structure
- README.md          # Project's README file


## Additional Information

### Implementation Details

The calculator logic is implemented in the `script.js` file using JavaScript. It handles user input, performs calculations, and updates the display in real-time. The `styles.css` file provides custom styling to create an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface.

### Future Enhancements

While the current version of the calculator is functional, some possible future enhancements to consider are:

- Adding support for more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
- Implementing a history feature to view past calculations.
- Improving the design to make it more visually appealing.
